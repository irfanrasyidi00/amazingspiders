## _Problem Statement_

Plant measurements are time-consuming and labor-intensive since most producers still use pens and clipboards. Furthermore, in order for these handwritten measures to be helpful, they must be put into a spreadsheet. We eliminate double processing of data, limit human mistake, and speed up crop registration by employing the crop registration function in our apps.

 Record over 10 crop measurement types:
 1. Growth
 2. Stem Diameter
 3. Leaf Length
 4. Leaf Width
 5. Leaves Per Plant
 6. Fruit Weight
 7. Fruit number per plant
 8. Flowering Speed
 9. Setting Speed
 10. Leaf Area Index

  - We are using MIT App Inventor as our input from user
  - We use Pythonanywhere to store data in SQLite3 Database, and we Design UI directly in the Pythonanywhere server.

 - Using MIT App Inventor to collect data from users.

## _Cloud Platform And Dashboad_

We use Pythonanywhere to store the data using SQLite3 database, and we design a UI on the server to act as the Dashboard.
